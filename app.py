It represents the derivative of the expression with respect to the variable 'x'.  \n\nTo find the derivative, you'll need to apply the rules of differentiation.  Think about the power rule and how it applies to terms like 2x^2 and the rule for differentiating terms with x in the denominator. \n\nRemember, the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.  Apply these rules to each term in the expression and you'll arrive at the solution. \n",
